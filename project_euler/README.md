# Project Euler
These are my solutions in x86_64 assembly to a few Project Euler problems.
I just did these to get a feel for the language.

- main.asm: source code
- run.sh:   assembles, links, runs, prints result
- gdb.txt:  since printing is a pain in assembly, run.sh uses gdb to get the result

In the case here I store the answer in the r8 register before exiting.
